Cryptoview is a website that allows you to track cryptocurrencies by consuming the CoinGecko API using Axios. In this text I'm going to tell you how I made this website using React and other technologies.

React is a JavaScript library for building interactive and declarative user interfaces. With React you can create reusable components that manage their own state and update automatically when data changes. In addition, React allows you to render from the server using Node or create mobile apps using React Native.

For my website, I used React to create a simple, dynamic interface that displays cryptocurrency information in real time. I used Axios, a JavaScript library for making HTTP requests, to consume the API of CoinGecko, a platform that provides data on prices, volumes and market capitalization of over 6000 cryptocurrencies.

To make dynamic routing for the pages of each cryptocurrency, I used React Router DOM, a library that allows you to create component-based routes and navigate between them with ease. So, every time the user selects a cryptocurrency, a page with the specific details of that currency is displayed.
In addition, my website has a user login system using Firebase, a platform that provides backend services such as authentication, database and storage. With Firebase I was able to create a secure and easy to use system for users to register and login with their email or with external providers such as Google or Facebook. I was also able to add functionality for users to add cryptocurrencies of their choice to a watchlist.

For the styling and responsive design of my website, I used Tailwind CSS, a CSS framework based on utility classes that can be composed to create any layout directly in the HTML. With Tailwind CSS I was able to customize colors, fonts, spacing and animations according to my taste and adapt them to different screen sizes using responsive modifiers.

Cryptoview is the result of my passion for web development and cryptocurrencies. I hope you enjoyed learning how I made this website using React and other technologies.
